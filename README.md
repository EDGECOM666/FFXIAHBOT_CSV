 this was a whole table dump forom item_basic table in the ffxidb that was formated into csv format for ffxiahbot

Please Note:
The prices are not pulled from any public server the prices are pulled from the NPC buy price if applicable.
If the price was not found or = 0 then a random price was generated as stated: ( 1k-5k for single items and 5k-10k for stacks.)

Also the name uses the ffxi sortname in the AH so its easier to read all itemid's should match items on FFXIAH
